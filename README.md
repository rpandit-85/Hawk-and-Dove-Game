# Hawk-and-Dove-Game

This was made as a final project for my Summer Game Theory and Economics Class. This code was written in Java to simulate the key Game Theory Concept of the Hawk and Dove Game. The hawk and dove game is a basic evolutionary game that models the interactions between an aggressive (hawk), and passive (dove) organism. I modeled this game using Giant Pandas and Snow Leopards.

The code simulates 10,000 random encounters in the population, and keeps track of the number of snow leopards and giant pandas over time. After the simulation is complete, a trend line for the population of the giant panda and the snow leopards are generated in displayed. The goal of the simulation is to show that over time, the percentage of the population of the aggressive species would increase, while the percentage of the population of the passive species would decrease. 

RULES
1 parcel of food = 650 calories 
A baby is born from every 2600 calories (4 parcels of food) 
Giant Pandas are passive and will run, while snow leopards are aggressive. 

GIANT PANDA VS SNOW LEOPARD OUTCOME
While the Giant Panda is very good at getting around the forest and escaping from any other predators, Leopards are good at almost everything that the panda can do, and faster at it. They are also very stealthy, giving the panda less time to react.
Because of this, it is very likely that the leopard will catch and kill the panda 
Out of this outcome, a panda would die and receive 0 parcels of food, and the Leopard would receive 10, however, the leopard would expend a low amount of energy going after the panda, which would use about a parcel of food.
Leopard population increases by 2 
Panda population decreases by 1

SNOW LEOPARD VS SNOW LEOPARD OUTCOME
2 apex predators, facing off. Each is equal in ability and tactics. 
In this encounter, each leopard will have to exert a lot of energy in the fight, equal to 3 parcels of food. 
In the gain, each leopard will get 5 parcels of food - the calories burned from the fight, which is a net profit of 2 parcels
Leopard population decreases by 2 because each of the leopards wonâ€™t have enough food for reproduction
There is a 50% chance one of the leopards will die from his wounds, decreasing population by 1 

GIANT PANDA VS GIANT PANDA OUTCOME
Giant pandas are relatively peaceful and solitary creatures, and so prefer to stay away from others of their kind 
Because of this, if two pandas interacted, they would each go their separate ways and share the food in the vicinity 
In the gain, each panda would get 5 parcels of food 
Panda population increases by 2
